# MachineLearning
Python programs exploring different machine learning algorithms for my Intro Machine Learning course.

These programs are fun ways to explore different model parameters to try to best solve regression and classification problems.
Currently has Linear Regression, Logarithmic Regression, and an MLP Regressor.
Each file has an attached PDF describing aspects of the model as well as discussion on the results.

To run:
Make sure you have Python, NumPy, and pandas installed onto your system.
Open a specific model folder in the IDE of your choice and run the .py file. The file will print some results to console.
Some programs have additional details in the comments, where code can be uncommented to provide additional graphs of data and results.
